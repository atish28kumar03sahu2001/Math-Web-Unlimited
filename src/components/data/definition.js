These operations form the basis of many mathematical computations and are used in various fields such as science, engineering, economics, and everyday problem-solving. The primary arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with more advanced operations like exponentiation and modulus."
export const Operand_Definition = "is the value or data on which an operation is performed. In mathematical expressions or programming, operands can be numbers, variables, or any data that is used in conjunction with an operator to produce a result. Operands act as inputs to operators. ";

The result of this operation is called the quotient, which represents the number of equal parts the dividend has been divided into. In cases where the dividend is not perfectly divisible by the divisor, there may be a leftover portion called the remainder. "
